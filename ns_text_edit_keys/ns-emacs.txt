NeXTSTEP

You issue Emacs commands with the Control key (Ctl) or the Escape (Esc) key, but how you give the command differs with each key. You press the Control key just before the character key, and keep pressing them together. For Escape commands, press the Escape Key first, then press the character key. Also, some commands begin with Control-x and are followed by a separate key press. The separation of the final character in Control-x and Escape commands isrepresented by a space.
