Emacs Commands


In addition to letting you edit text using menu commands (and their keyboard equivalents), Edit also supports several Emacs-style editing commands that can be typed from the keyboard. 

For Emacs commands, the Key Bindings On option must be set with the Preferences command in the Info menu. (To find this option, choose Global Options from the pop-up list at the top of the Preferences panel.)

The table below lists the key combination corresponding to each command and a description of what the command does.
